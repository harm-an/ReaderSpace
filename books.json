    "description": "In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the mans wisdom is his gift. It is Gibrans gift to us, as well, for Gibrans prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the worlds great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description divinely inspired. Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

    "description": "This companion volume to Coelhos popular The Alchemist is an odd hybrid-a self-help manual with fictional overtones; a series of aphorisms and platitudes set within the frame of the sketchiest of parables. In the parable, a boy meets a beautiful woman at a beach, who proceeds to tell him about a hidden undersea temple near a vanished island. The boy fails in his initial attempt to find the temple, though he hears its bells ring, but later, as a grown man, he again meets the woman, who hands him an empty notebook and directs him to write about the 'Warrior of the Light,' a being who is capable of understanding the miracle of life, of fighting to the last for something he believes in-and of hearing the bells that the waves set ringing on the seabed. Some of the aphorisms that follow have a specific spiritual source-Lao Tzu, Gandhi, Jesus and Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, among others, are quoted. Coelho provides general spiritual inspiration, but he also offers guidance in more mundane matters, explaining the specific motivations behind childish, immature behavior, cowardly moments, feelings of spiritual emptiness and the reluctance to change. Some of these passages are original, but others merely repackage common inspirational fodder. The volume preserves the basic spiritual tone of The Alchemist, but readers expecting comparable depth and substance will be disappointed.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a prostitute called Maria-thus begins Coelhos latest novel, a book that cannot decide whether it wants to be fairy tale or saga of sexual discovery, so ends up satisfying the demands of neither. In his dedication, bestselling Brazilian novelist Coelho (The Alchemist) tells readers that his book will deal with issues that are harsh, difficult, shocking, but neither his tame forays into S&amp;M nor his rather technical observations about female anatomy and the sad but hardly new fact that many women are dissatisfied with their sex lives will do much to shock American readers. In Maria, however, the author has created a strong, sensual young woman who grabs our sympathy from the first, as she suffers unrequited love as a child, learns a bit about sex as a teenager and, at 19, makes the ill-advised decision to leave Rio on a Swedish strangers promise of fame and fortune. Marias trials and triumphs-she goes from restaurant dancer to high-class prostitute-would make for an entertaining if rather prosaic novel, but Coelho, unfortunately, does not leave it there. Instead, he embarks on a philosophical exploration of sexual love, using Marias increasingly ponderous and pseudo-philosophical diary entries as a means for expounding on the nature of sexual desire, passion and love. At the end, the story boils down to a rather predictable romance tarted up with a few sexy trappings.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "In 1927, Walter Evans-Wentz published his translation of an obscure Tibetan Nyingma text and called it theTibetan Book of the Dead. Popular Tibetan teacher Sogyal Rinpoche has transformed that ancient text, conveying a perennial philosophy that is at once religious, scientific, and practical. Through extraordinary anecdotes and stories from religious traditions East and West, Rinpoche introduces the reader to the fundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism, moving gradually to the topics of death and dying. Death turns out to be less of a crisis and more of an opportunity. Concepts such as reincarnation, karma, and bardo and practices such as meditation, tonglen, and phowa teach us how to face death constructively. As a result, life becomes much richer. LikeElisabeth Kubler-Ross, Sogyal Rinpoche opens the door to a full experience of death. It is up to the reader to walk through.--Brian Bruya",

It traces a spiritual journey of sorts, stereotypically cast as a journey into the desert, that embodies a New Age conception of liberation as liberation from the past in confrontation with oneself. The ritual that demolishes rituals, which is the climax of the book, is all done with mirrors.

    "description": "The press chat cites 65 million copies of Coelhos eight previous novels in print, making the Brazilian author one of the worlds bestselling novelists (150 countries and 56 languages). This book, whose title means the present or unable to go unnoticed in Arabic, has an initial staggered laydown of eight million copies in 83 countries and 42 languages. It centers on the narrators search for his missing wife, Esther, a journalist who fled Iraq in the runup to the present war, only to disappear from Paris; the narrator, a writer, is freed from suspicion when his lover, Marie, comes forward with a (true) alibi. He seeks out Mikhail, the man who may be Esthers most recent lover and with whom she was last seen, who has abandoned his native Kazakhstan for a kind of speaking tour on love. Mikhail introduces the narrator to a global underground tribe of spiritual seekers who resist, somewhat vaguely, conventional ways of living. Through the narrators journey from Paris to Kazakhstan, Coelho explores various meanings of love and life, but the impact of these lessons is diminished significantly as they are repeated in various forms by various characters. Then again, 65 million readers cant be wrong; the spare, propulsive style that droveThe Alchemist,Eleven Minutesand Coelhos other books will easily carry fans through myriad iterations of the ways and means ofamor.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Portobello of the title is Londons Portobello Road, where Sherine Khalil, aka Athena, finds the worship meeting shes leading&mdash;where she becomes an omniscient goddess named Hagia Sophia&mdash;disrupted by a Protestant protest. Framed as a set of interviews conducted with those who knew Athena, who is dead as the book opens, the story recounts her birth in Transylvania to a Gypsy mother, her adoption by wealthy Lebanese Christians; her short, early marriage to a man she meets at a London college (one of the interviewees); her son Viorels birth; and her stint selling real estate in Dubai. Back in London in the books second half, Athena learns to harness the powers that have been present but inchoate within her, and the story picks up as she acquires a teacher (Deidre ONeill, aka Edda, another interviewee), then disciples (also interviewed), and speeds toward a spectacular end. Coelho veers between his signature criticism of modern life and the hydra-headed alternative that Athena taps into.

Brother Juniper wonders if the tragedy happened according to a divine plan or was simply a random instance of misfortune. His curiosity leads him to investigate the lives of the five victims to prove that the bridge collapse and the resulting deaths were indeed divine intervention&#x2014;that God intended for them to die then and there. But, of course, the point of the novel is that there is no commonality among them, other than the fact that they are all simply human, with their own frailties. Wilder ends his at-once urgent and serene novel with this haunting passage: &#x201C;But soon we shall die and all memory of these five will have left the earth, and we ourselves shall be loved for a while and forgotten. But the love will have been enough; all those impulses of love return to the love that made them. Even memory is not necessary for love. There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.&#x201D; --Brad Hooper--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

By the time she reaches Oklahoma, this strong-willed young Kentucky native with a quick tongue and an open mind is catapulted into a surprising new life. Taylor leaves home in a beat-up 55 Volkswagen bug, on her way to nowhere in particular, savoring her freedom. But when a forlorn Cherokee woman drops a baby in Taylors passenger seat and asks her to take it, she does. A first novel, The Bean Trees is an overwhelming delight, as random and unexpected as real life. The unmistakable voice of its irresistible heroine is whimsical, yet deeply insightful. Taylor playfully names her little foundling Turtle, because she clings with an unrelenting, reptilian grip; at the same time, Taylor aches at the thought of the silent, staring childs past suffering. With Turtle in tow, Taylor lands in Tucson, Ariz., with two flat tires and decides to stay. The desert climate, landscape and vegetation are completely foreign to Taylor, and in learning to love Arizona, she also comes face to face with its rattlesnakes and tarantulas. Similarly, Taylor finds that motherhood, responsibility and independence are thorny, if welcome, gifts.

A Sarah Lawrence college dropout, she is living as the mistress--one of many, she would later find out--of her best friends stepfather, Lenny, a high-profile New York City lawyer. It is the height of the excessive 80s, and Lenny goes to extravagant lengths to keep his woman--putting her up in a large downtown apartment, draping her in furs and flashy gems, and spiriting her away by Concorde to Paris for weekend flings. When she isnt with Lenny, Shapiro leisurely courts an acting and modeling career and actively pursues her drug dealer, who delivers cocaine to her door. She is at an expensive spa in California--at a far remove from the middle-class, orthodox Jewish home in which she was raised--when, one snowy night, her parents car careens into a highway median. When she returns to New Jersey, to her parents hospital bedsides, she begins the journey to discover and mine her inner strength. She succeeds, and though the process is as arduous as it is painful, Shapiro finds within herself the power to nurse her mother through nearly 100 broken bones, to survive her fathers death, and to reset the course of her life.Slow Motionends where its subjects troubles began: with Shapiro, newly single, re-enrolling as an undergrad at Sarah Lawrence.Shapiro, who is the author of three previous novels, writes sparely and lacks the excessive self-consciousness that plagues some memoirs.

He also warns readers that what follows will not be a pretty, happy book of love poetry: This is not Norman Vincent Peale urging cheerfulness, conventional morality, and soft-focus, white-light, feel-good...New Age tantric energy exchange. This is giving your life to the one within that you know as LORD, which is a totally private matter. Rumi, he writes, is not the stuff of greeting cards. The poetry, accessibly translated and arranged by Barks, is organized by loose themes such as loves discipline, the new life with the beloved, sudden wholeness, and loves excess.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

    "description": "When Rumi was born in Afghanistan in 1207, it was a time of tremendous  political turmoil in the Near East. Paradoxically, it was also a time of  brilliant mystical awareness, writes translator Coleman Barks inThe Soul  of Rumi. This brilliance shines through in every passage, as Barks  celebrates the ecstatic nature of Rumis poetry. Barks (The Essential Rumi) has been  given much credit for leading modern Westerners to this astounding poet. His  sensitivity to the reader is evidenced in how he organizes the poetry according  to themes. Since Rumi is often quoted at public gatherings, such as weddings and  memorial services, this makes referencing especially easy. In the section  entitled When Friend Meets Friend, readers find the poem The Souls Friend:The most living moment comes when those who love each other meet  each others eyes and in what flows between them then. To see your face in a crowd of others, or alone on a  frightening street, I weep for that&#x85;.Barks offers a gracefully rendered introduction to each section, providing  personal and historical background of the poetry. Elegantly designed and printed  on cream-colored, heavy-stock paper, this is a delight for Rumi fans.--Gail  Hudson--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Sadly, narrator Linda Emonds uninspired and monotonous reading is a disservice to this fantastic tale. Though the story is set in Ireland during the mid-80s, Emond makes no attempt at a regional dialect or even the slightest shift in tone for any of the characters. Her narrative voice is dull and uninspired, read with a soft whisper that will surely put most listeners to sleep before it ignites their imaginations. The story would be much better served with a narrator more willing to put their performance skills to the test and dive into the story.A Harper hardcover (Reviews, Apr. 28).

    "description": "When the media announced in early July 2012 that researchers had finally confirmed the existence of the elusive Higgs boson, aka &#x201C;the God particle,&#x201D; physicists around the world hailed the discovery as a major scientific breakthrough. To California Institute of Technology researcher Carroll (From Eternity to Here, 2010), the event gave another opportunity to demonstrate what he does best, translating complicated ideas into lay-friendly language. In describing how the Higgs boson was detected after decades of theoretical speculation, Carroll covers a wide swath of science, from the Big Bang to quantum mechanics, as well as the thorny politics behind funding the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, where experiments established the particle&#x2019;s existence. Along with an overview of abstract concepts like supersymmetry, Carroll more lightheartedly explains why Hollywood loves science and why the world wasn&#x2019;t likely to end if the collider inadvertently created a mini-black-hole.

    "description": "In his now classicZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we cant define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar&eacute;, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrators claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic ofZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenanceturns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross betweenThe Razors EdgeandSophies World,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenancetakes us into the high country of the mind and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility.--Brian Bruya--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Daniel Matts continued wonder at the confounding brilliance of kabbalistic writings is evident in this loving presentation of the key texts from the Jewish mystical tradition. This fine sampling of works from the earliest medieval European texts to 20th-century interpretations includes poems, symbolic stories, meditations, and ruminations by such important figures as Moses de Leon, Moses Cordovero, Isaac Luria, and Abraham Isaac Kook. Matts translations have both a spareness and a poetic flair that makes reading these highly esoteric selections a richly moving experience.The words of 14th-century mystic Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov, for example, are rendered with a startling immediacy: &quot;How did God create the world?  Like a person taking a deep breath and holding it, so that the small contains the large. Similarly God contracted his light to a divine handbreadth, and the world was left in darkness. In the darkness God carved cliffs and hewed rocks to clear the wondrous paths of wisdom.&quot; A short introduction traces the history of Kabbalah, explaining its salient concepts and symbols, and extensive notes provide background on the featured texts and writers. A brief bibliography is provided for those who will want to savor more of these extraordinary texts after tasting their richness in this collection.--Uma Kukathas--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Despite the popularity of Sufism, few books provide an overview of this mystical branch of Islam&mdash; a void Nasr, professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University, fills nicely, albeit briefly, with this concise primer. Sufism teaches that all aspects of life&mdash;from nature to other people&mdash;are signs of God, and yet the grandeur of God is beyond human comprehension. The goal of each Sufi is to take an inner journey to transcend the human state, to illuminate the dark corners of our soul and reconnect with the inner divinity implanted by God at creation. Nasrs book is not a how-to introduction on removing the veils erected by imperfection, which manifest as evil and block our divine roots, but a wise and tantalizing overview. He also includes a detailed and rare history of the Sufi movement and a brief catalogue of the various Sufi orders. Although readers with no prior background in Sufism may struggle with this rather dense intellectual study of the movement, it provides valuable information about the often overlooked philosophical underpinnings of Sufism along with obscure details that will be fascinating to more advanced practitioners.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "Douglas-Klotz, scholar and Sufi leader, uses his considerable Semitic language skills to explore the 99 pathways to God, each representing a quality of the One. Douglas-Klotz uses the root and pattern system of Arabic vowels to liberally interpret these qualities as inseparable from many other traditions, notably the Aramaic tradition of Jesus. Additionally, his exegeses draw from the tradition of diversity, inclusion and heterodoxy that has anchored Sufism since the time of Rumi. Although Douglas-Klotz states that his exegeses are meant to be deliberately multivalent and somewhat enigmatic, they may prove opaque for many readers, especially those expecting an accessible how-to handbook for the modern dervish. Despite Douglas-Klotzs early admonishment Dont worry about getting the point, a high level of linguistic technicality is typical of at least half the pathways, and readers will have to take him at his word when he draws complex connections. Nonetheless, his intriguing insights, meditation tips and, above all, his inclusive spirit should trump technical details to appeal to readers within many religious traditions. Appendixes offer short biographies of Sufi men and women throughout history; contact information for Sufi organizations, orders and centers; and formal transliterations of the 99 pathways.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "Though he takes a different tack than Wyller (above), Miller tries to draw a straight line between two apparently opposing ideas: the theory of evolution and belief in a creator. In a more humanistic account than Wyllers, Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University, explains the difference between evolution as validated scientific fact and as an evolving theory. He illustrates his contentions with examples from astronomy, geology, physics and molecular biology, confronting the illogic of creationists with persuasive reasons based on the known physical properties of the universe and the demonstrable effects of time on the radioactivity of various elements. Then standing firmly on Darwinian ground, he turns to take on, with equal vigor, his outspoken colleagues in science who espouse a materialistic, agnostic or atheistic vision of reality. Along the way, he addresses such important questions as free will in a planned universe. Miller is particularly incisive when he discusses the emotional reasons why many people oppose evolution and the scientific communitys befuddled, often hostile, reaction to sincere religious belief. Throughout, he displays an impressive fairness, which he communicates in friendly, conversational prose. This is a book that will stir readers of both science and theology, perhaps satisfying neither, but challenging both to open their minds. Illustrations.

Attar was a Persian Sufi of the 12th  century and his masterpiece isThe Conference of the Birds, an epic  allegory of the seekers journey to God. When all the birds of the world convene  and determine that they lack a king, one bird steps forward and offers to lead  them to a great and mighty monarch. Initially excited, each bird falters in  turn, whereupon the leader admonishes them with well-targeted parables. These  pithy tales are the delight of this 4,500-line poem, translated deftly into  rhymed couplets. What is your excuse for not seeking God? Your life is fine  already? You prefer material pleasure? You are holy enough? You have pride, lack  courage, or are burdened with responsibility? Attar has an answer to encourage  you on the path to the promised land.

An excellent companion to Nomanis first book,Tantrika, this memoir treads similar ground, chronicling her pilgrimage to Mecca, or hajj, in 2003. Throughout the book, Nomani is filled with self-doubt and healthy frustration with her Islamic faith. The portions describing hajj, particularly the other pilgrims warmth to her infant son, are original and enjoyable. [...] The second half of the book records Nomanis pioneering struggle at her mosque for equal treatment of women. Daring to enter the mens door at the mosque, Nomani is repeatedly ostracized, and her father&mdash;a founder of the mosque&mdash;vilified by his counterparts. Nomani decries the Wahhabi takeover of American mosques and demands reform&mdash;a call that will resonate with the average American Muslim. The stories of her preteen niece and nephew introduce readers to a new generation of Muslims who are American and equality-minded. Through memorable personal narrative, Nomani gently instructs readers about modern Islam and her role as a woman within it.(Jan. 18)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "No translator could do greater justice to the gorgeous simplicity of Rumis poetry than Coleman Barks has done here. These exquisite renderings of the 13th-century Persian mystics words into American free verse capture all the &quot;inner searching, the delicacy, and simple groundedness&quot; that characterize Rumis poetry while remaining faithful to the images, tone, and spiritual message of the originals. Barkss introductions to each of the 27 sections (described as &quot;playful palimpsests spread over Rumis imagination,&quot; and &quot;meant to confuse scholars who would divide Rumis poetry into the accepted categories&quot;) are themselves wonderful achievements of a poetic imagination; searching explanations of unfamiliar concepts and funny stories provide colorful background and frame the selections as no dry historical exegesis could.While Barkss stamp on this collection is clear, it in no way interferes with the poems themselves; Rumis voice leaps off these pages with an ecstatic energy that leaves readers breathless. There are poems of love, rage, sadness, pleading, and longing; passionate outbursts about the torture of longing for his beloved and the sweet pleasure that comes from their union; amusing stories of sexual exploits or human weakness; and quiet truths about the beauty and variety of human emotion. More than anything, Rumi makes plain the unbridled joy that comes from living life fully, urging us always to put aside our fears and take the risk to do so.  As he says: &quot;The way of love is not / a subtle argument. / The door there is devastation. / Birds make great sky-circles / of their freedom. / How do they learn it? / They fall, and falling, / theyre given wings.&quot;--Uma Kukathas--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Grade 9 Up - Sixteen-year-old Miles Halters adolescence has been one long nonevent - no challenge, no girls, no mischief, and no real friends. Seeking what Rabelais called the Great Perhaps, he leaves Florida for a boarding school in Birmingham, AL. His roommate, Chip, is a dirt-poor genius scholarship student with a Napoleon complex who lives to one-up the schools rich preppies. Chips best friend is Alaska Young, with whom Miles and every other male in her orbit falls instantly in love. She is literate, articulate, and beautiful, and she exhibits a reckless combination of adventurous and self-destructive behavior. She and Chip teach Miles to drink, smoke, and plot elaborate pranks. Alaskas story unfolds in all-night bull sessions, and the depth of her unhappiness becomes obvious. Greens dialogue is crisp, especially between Miles and Chip. His descriptions and Miless inner monologues can be philosophically dense, but are well within the comprehension of sensitive teen readers. The chapters of the novel are headed by a number of days before and after what readers surmise is Alaskas suicide. These placeholders sustain the mood of possibility and foreboding, and the story moves methodically to its ambiguous climax. The language and sexual situations are aptly and realistically drawn, but sophisticated in nature. Miles narration is alive with sweet, self-deprecating humor, and his obvious struggle to tell the story truthfully adds to his believability. Like Phineas in John KnowlessA Separate Peace(S &amp; S, 1960), Green draws Alaska so lovingly, in self-loathing darkness as well as energetic light, that readers mourn her loss along with her friends.- Johanna Lewis, New York Public LibraryCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "This book is based on Williamsons discovery of A Course in Miracles , a self-help guide whose provenance she doesnt explain. Age 26 at the time and feeling lost and desperate after indulging in the excesses of the 1960s, the Jewish author had no real hope for inspiration from the course because of its Christian terminology. But, she writes in this guide to the guide, the program works miracles for herself and for others who adopt its principles. Her extrapolations may appeal to readers in need of spiritual sustenance, but one questions Williamsons advice to the gravely ill. When she encourages them, for example, to write a letter to AIDS or cancer or whatever illness they might have, and tell it everything they feel--even to fabricate replies from the disease--readers are likely to consider that a serious situation is trivialized. Williamson is founder and president of the Los Angeles and Manhattan Center for Living, a support service.

From ear infections to sore throats, food poisoning to chickenpox, children seem to come home with some new germ every week. Fortunately, there is much parents can do to reduce the number of infections that children contract, and parents will be greatly relieved to turn to this book for advice and guidance when facing everything from the common cold to more serious infections such as meningitis. This book provides the information parents need about the most common infections that their children are likely to catch, as well as diseases that are guarded against by vaccines, and some rarer diseases that parents should know about in case of an emergency. It is intended to help parents identify these diseases and make educated decisions about when a child needs medical intervention or attention, or whether home treatment is warranted. Organized from A to Z, the entries include information about each infection:causessymptomshow it spreadsincubation periodwhen to call the doctordiagnosistreatmentpreventionAlso included in the book is an index of symptoms and a series of appendices with vaccine recommendations, advice for day-care workers on the prevention of outbreaks, and other handy resources for parents.

Tourists will find valuable information on these pages, and this is a good guide for planning trips as well as taking along as a travel companion. Although the bulk of the book is devoted to the Civil War, a major strength of American Battlefields is that it doesn't ignore some of the less-famous conflicts, such as the French and Indian Wars, the War of 1812, and the War with Mexico. The American Revolution, the Alamo, the Wars with Native Americans, and Pearl Harbor also get their due. Two-color maps provide helpful reference points throughout.--John Miller",

    "description": "Frazier was born in 1944 in rural South Carolina, one of 13 children of a father who also boasted of 13 other kids born out of wedlock. Unable to adjust to life in the South, Frazier went to New York City at age 15 and then to Philadelphia, where eventually a syndicate of businessmen backed him in the ring. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1964 and, after Muhammad Ali was stripped of his title as heavyweight champion for refusing military induction during the Vietnam War, Frazier was named champion in 1970. The following year, he defeated the reinstated Ali and reigned until 1973, when he lost his title to George Foreman. Once a friend of Ali, he became an enemy after a steady barrage of insults from 'The Louisville Lip,' and it's noteworthy that he always refers to Ali in these pages as Cassius Clay (his pre-Muslim name). Frazier has never ceased to work, nor has he lost faith in the American dream, so his autobiography, written with prize-winning boxing journalist Berger, may prove inspirational to young people.

Do they constitute lineal ancestors or a separate evolutionary branch? Were they exterminated or absorbed by humans about 30,000 years ago? Interpretations of the evidence excite strenuous debate among the experts, as chronicled in James Shreeve'sThe Neandertal Enigma,so what 's a curious amateur to make of the brouhaha? That's where Tattersall(also a museum curator) excels as he conveys the essentials of the technical literature to the public.These consist of methods by which Neanderthal sites are dated,what inferences may be drawn from the fossils ' anatomy, and for background, a narrative of current knowledge about the hominid line. Abundant full-page photos of specimens and archaeological digs cement Tattersall's clarity on the topic, making this an immeasurable aid to students and armchair anthropologists alike.Gilbert Taylor",

'We seem to consume more of the former.' In 1957, when Randleman herself was 10 years old, her prosperous family emigrated to Miami from Cuba. Her memories of pre-Castro life and eating are filtered through a golden haze of childhood recollection: cousin Pepe entertains his family at meriendasic (afternoon tea), in which 'steaming trays began appearing from the kitchen, borne by a parade of indulgent maids and cooks, and glamorous Aunt Titi drives the young Randelman to the Havana Yacht Club for incomparable freshly fried potato chips and croquetassic 'filled with smoky creamed ham and splashed with lime juice. 'The Cuban national cuisine as it emerges here is a fusion of Spanish, African, Chinese and Portuguese elements, as one sees in a dish such as okra stew with plaintain dumplings ( guiso de quimbombo ), containing root vegetables, sherry, bacon and Cuban beef stock, always seasoned with cumin.92 Lime juice is used liberally, both as marinade and flavoring.

    "description": "The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook Ever since the first California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was opened in Beverly Hills in 1985, founders Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield have been inundated with requests for their creative pizza recipes. As Larry and Rick explain in the introduction, the recipe for their success is simple&#151;take America&#39;s favorite food cravings, like barbecued chicken, shrimp scampi, Peking duck, Thai satay, Southwestern burrito and BLT, and put them on a pizza. Until now, the official recipes were a secret. You could only get their California-style pizza at one of more than 80 CPK restaurants across the country, baked fresh in a wood-burning oven. The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook includes all of your favorite pizza recipes, right off the menu, including the original BBQ Chicken Pizza, Thai Chicken Pizza, Shrimp Pesto Pizza, Santa Fe Chicken Pizza, and Mixed Grill Vegetarian Pizza. There are more than 25 delicious pizza recipes in all, plus an extra chapter with the creative CPK pastas, salads, soups and appetizers. And don&#39;t forget the dough&#151;you&#39;ll also find recipes for CPK&#39;s Basic Pizza Dough as well as honey-wheat pizza dough, with step-by-step instructions and photographs so even a beginner can master the techniques of tossing dough at home. The best thing about The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook&#151;maybe even better than their recipe for BBQ Chicken Pizza&#151;is that founders Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield are donating all of the royalties to charitable organizations across the country. It&#39;s their way of saying thanks to Americans for all of their support. So whether you&#39;re a pizza aficionado and can&#39;t wait to impress your friends with an &quot;anything-goes&quot; pizza party, or you know someone who loves to create food that is on the cutting edge, The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook is sure to please.",

    "description": "In a welcome effort to convince lawyers to streamline their legalese and improve the comprehensibility of their writing, attorney Faulk and Mehler, who has taught at the University of Denver School of Law, have compiled essentially a grammar and stylebook for the legal profession. The thorough table of contents lists the rules of clear writing, diction, tone, grammar, syntax, punctuation, capitalization, paragraph construction, organization, and format. Drawn mostly from actual legal writing, the examples illustrating these principles point out anachronistic lawyerisms and suggest better alternatives. Otherwise, this book would seem somewhat redundant since so many similar handbooks already exist, such as Strunk and White's classic Elements of Style. A glossary of grammatical terms and a bibliography of books and articles on legal writing conclude the text. A possible candidate for law libraries and law offices.Cathy Sabol, Northern Virginia Community Coll., ManassasCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

As it took an extraordinary man of  will in Jackie Robinson to bear the on-the-field brunt of Rickey's daring,  it took a man of equal resolve and courage to conceive and implement  the plan in the first place. Rickey, creator as well of baseball's farm  system, left a giant and enduring legacy. This slim volume of epigrams  and observations--on character, attitude, and baseball itself--compiled  from his letters, notes, and personal papers is a treasure trove of good  sense, keen insight, and, indeed, some genuine inspiration, a true  reflection of the singular man who penned them.",

    "description": "After buying hoards of guidebooks to help him ferret out the best places to try out his latest Northwest outdoor pursuit (mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, etc.), author Karl Samson kept wishing for one complete outdoor adventure guide. That's exactly what he's attempted to pull together inOutside Magazine's Adventure Guide to the Pacific Northwest, featuring hundreds of trips, trails, and little-known wild places in Washington and Oregon--from the Cascades to the coast. It would take a committed adventurer years just to get through Samson's listings of his favorites (swimming holes, whale watching sites, day hikes, snowshoeing trails, salt water kayak spots, and such)--a good indication that this book is well stocked. Each chapter covers an area within the region, gets you oriented in &quot;Lay of the Land,&quot; covers &quot;Parks and Other Hot Spots,&quot; &quot;Campgrounds and Other Accommodations,&quot; and &quot;What to Do and Where to Do It.&quot; There is decidedly plenty to do, and those looking for in-depth coverage may find the brevity of the listings off-putting. However, Samson does an excellent job of packing a surprisingly readable amount of information into every one of the 478 pages. Sidebar features offer everything from Internet resources to the hibernation habits of marmots. If you're heading to the Northwest,check it out.--Kathryn True",

    "description": "There's no better antidote to the dreary non-gardening months than a great read, and in this gallery of colorful portraits, Chotzinoff, a columnist for Garden Design, delivers one of the most amusing, eclectic gardening books in recent memory. Curiosity led her to some unusual corners of the U.S.-locales as different as a Louisiana bayou, a New Mexico chile farm, an elegant Virginia estate and Manhattan's wild underbelly to name just a few-where she met with diverse and offbeat gardeners to find out what makes them tick. The result is a series of lively and highly entertaining interviews. Her subjects, sensing a kindred spirit in Chotzinoff, prove a winningly chatty group, and the author makes the most of their willingness to run on about their individual passions-be they rustling roses in Texas, collecting heirloom seeds or growing prize-winning giant tomatoes with names like 'Radiator Charlie's Mortgage Lifter.' Pull the chair up closer to the fire, sit back and enjoy the company. This group is sheer delight.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

    "description": "First published in 1939 by the director of the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture and her landscape architect husband, the latest complete revision of this massive reference draws on the expertise of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's savvy staff. Written by American gardeners for American gardeners, the book addresses the specific needs of U.S. climate zones, giving it a distinct advantage over some of imported heavyweight rivals. The text itself is workmanlike, with the prose showing occasional signs of being developed by committee (an exception is the lively section on roses, written by BBG rosarian Stephen Scaniello). But what's missing in 'voice ' is more than made up for in sheer mass of horticultural wisdom. Crammed with photographs, charts, exhaustive plant lists and information on every conceivable topic of interest to gardeners, this is truly a comprehensive reference. Not a corner of the gardening kingdom is left unexamined: overall design; the nitty gritty of selecting tools; the ins and outs of composting and lawn care; such currently popular trends as water, wildlife and container gardening; the special requirements of city and seaside gardeners (among other specialty sites); ornamentals of every sort as well as vegetables, fruits and herbs; even greenhouse construction and maintenance. Those looking for a lively read may wish to look elsewhere. Readers looking for one-stop shopping in the gardening reference arena will have come to the right place here.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Burdock is easily located in the section on root vegetables. The Encyclopedia provides pictures of the whole plant and of the root in question (a whitish, spongy thing with a thin, brownish skin), a short history of the vegetable (originally from Siberia, now cultivated in Japan), buying tips (look for firmness), and ideas of what to do with the leftovers (try a stir-fry, or grate some for a stew).No food categories are overlooked. The pasta section tells how to make pasta from scratch, and illustrates all manner of pasta types. There are detailed instructions on preparing snails, sea urchins, and frog (thisisa translation from a French edition)--and all manner of foods are included, from fruits, grains, and vegetables to seaweed, fats, and tea to dairy, fish, and meat. Some ingredients get more attention than others (all the pear varieties, for example, from Anjou and Bosc to Comice and Passe-Crassane, are pictured and described in detail, while the various chili peppers don't get as full a treatment), but with more than 1,000 ingredients, 1,200 illustrations, and a goodly number of recipes as well, this is a corker of a food reference, of value to any cook, from novice to weekend gourmet to professional chef.--Stephanie Gold",

The book gives a wide range of information, covering such topics as starting and designing a garden; dealing with climate, soil, lighting, mulching, fertilizing, and watering; making compost; and controlling weeds. The best part, though, is the more than 420 descriptions (most with color photographs) of annuals, perennials, bulbs, roses, vegetables, herbs, ground covers, and vines. There are also excellent sections on the proper tools and equipment, controlling pest and disease problems, and the questions most asked by gardeners (divided into categories for easy reference), as well as a season-by-season guide to garden maintenance. Along with the photographs, the book includes many instructional drawings along with neat pictures of Burpee catalogs and seed packets dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s. The latter provide a touch of personality and charm that, unfortunately, the book otherwise lacks.

Recipes and techniques are here in abundance, yet the book is truly for those who always wished that culinary introductions, notes and sidelights on appreciation would never end. Martinez delivers both personal reminiscence and cultural insight with the taste and candor of an experienced hostess--a memoir of a family servant nestles up with a fiercely patriotic sidebar on the 'Manana Syndrome.' Raised among Sonora's ranching aristocracy ('By the time I was 14 I was busting broncos '), she shows how she came to immerse herself in her country's food traditions and--beginning with modest catering projects--soon found herself lionized in New York by the likes of Paul Prudhomme and Craig Claiborne. Her approach is not one of ethnic purity or 'authenticity' understood narrowly; she blithely combines traditions from different regions within single recipes, 'my own personal process of mestizajesic, synthesis.' And, indeed, she attributes the makings of her crab enchilada to a chef for a California restaurant chain.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Athletes and other physically active people cannot readily pursue a vegetarian regimen because so many current vegetarian cookbooks focus on simply keeping meats out of the diet and too many vegetarian diets lack the food energy sources required for intense competition. Kleiner and Friedman-Kester set out to restore high energy levels to vegetarian diets with their full-flavored recipes that draw on a broad spectrum of nonmeat foods to ensure that active people miss no essential nutrients. The book teems with nutritional advice, particularly when dealing with sources for newly important minerals, such as zinc, normally found usefully and abundantly only in meat products. Some of the authors' recipes are predictable;others, especially those for breads, muffins, and other baked goods, may be attractive even to nonvegetarians.Mark Knoblauch",

Here Sowell (The Pitch That Killed) looks back at the triumphs and tragedies that followed that fateful post-season. In the Boston-California playoffs we see California manager Gene Mauch?'the greatest manager never to win a pennant ' ? one out away from victory, and still managing to lose.Donnie Moore ? the relief pitcher who bore the brunt of the loss ? was so depressed by the outcome that he killed himself.In the New York - Houston series, we witness pitcher Bob Knepper blowing two big leads;experience the fear that Mike Scott and his split - finger fastball instilled in the Mets;and feel the tension of game six ? 16 innings of perhaps the best baseball game ever played ?finally going to the Mets.The Red Sox - Mets World Series had it all : comebacks, hero,goats.There is drama as Mookie Wilson squibbs the ball past a crippled Bill Buckner; we meet nervous relief pitcher Calvin Schiraldi, who lacks the confidence to get the big out;Pat Stapleton, Buckner's caddy, waiting for the call to defense that never came; and Ray Knight, goat-turned-hero, hitting the ball out of the park to win the Series for the Mets.

    "description": "Looking to live somewhere where houses are cheap? Head to Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa, where the average home costs $75,700, and annual property taxes for that home are about $960. Perhaps a good job market is a higher priority. In that case, pick Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; or Riverside, California, as they top the list of places projected to have the highest-percentage increase in new jobs by 2005. Most of those jobs, by the way, are expected to have above-average pay. This and other detailed information can be found in the sixth edition ofPlaces Rated Almanac, a helpful resource for people thinking of relocating as well as those with a desire to learn about cities and towns. Metropolitan areas are rated in nine categories: costs of living, job outlook, transportation, education, health care, crime, the arts, recreation, and climate. But don\"t go looking for statistics on Podunk--the focus remains on 354 metro areas,metrodefined as a city or urbanized population of at least 50,000, located in a county with a total population of at least 100,000.Places Ratedis laced with intelligent and, unexpectedly, witty writing. The whole concept of judging places, the author notes, may seem the utmost of brass. 'Yet everyone does it, privately. Some suspect that culture in Omaha or Des Moines or Saskatoon is a contradiction.Others surmise that daily life in Miami consists of surviving drug - trade shoot - outs...' Organized intelligently,Places Ratedacknowledges that 'livability 'and 'quality of life ' are moving targets. Livable for whom? The artist who wants mountain vistas? The entrepreneur who wants low taxes and no red tape? With these limitations in mind, the book ends with a chapter titled 'Putting It All Together, where the reader is invited to rate cities with a customized list of priorities. Arriving at your customized list, however, requires answering 72 questions that force you to decide once and for all what you value most--a low cost of living or good school districts or mild winters or some other criterion. And should you find that climate matters most, head for Santa Barbara, California, where winters and summers are mild and natural hazards are few, and stay away from Rochester, Minnesota, unless you\"re willing to endure 35 days when it's 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and 165 days of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, annually.--John Russell--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

But not all visual dictionaries  are created equal. You use them all, of course, for the words, to  learn the language or the specific name for this and that, but the  visual aspect of the visual dictionary should not be ignored. The  pictures and pages in some dictionaries are so overwhelmingly busy, so  noisily shouting with motorcycle parts and electrical hardware that  the eye goes into overload shock. You get that glassy  I'm - looking - but - I'm-not-seeing glaze, and the dictionary goes back on  the shelf. Not so Macmillan's version. The color illustrations on each  page are better than easy on the eye: they're engaging;they invite you.And each page holds a comfortable amount of information so the language center of your brain doesn't turn to mush.

    "description": "WhileAsian Soups, Stews, and Curriesis dedicated to what are simply called &quot;one pot&quot; dishes, there is nothing simple about the vast range of foods the book covers, including recipes from the subcontinent through China to Southeast Asia. Author Alexandra Greeley has drawn on her personal experiences and travels in Asia, and put together one of the most comprehensive collections available. Her goal was to collect as many representative dishes as possible and present them in a user-friendly way for western chefs and kitchens--no small task, considering the trying conditions and variety of languages she encountered.The book is divided by primary ingredients--chicken, beef, seafood, and vegetables--and includes regional recipes for each. Cooks new to the cuisine will be surprised to find that Asian dishes are quickly cooked with lively flavors and bear little resemblance, if any, to slow-cooked, stock-based western soups and stews. Greeley also does a tremendous job in debunking western conceptions about curries, and demonstrates them as a staple of Asian cuisine with infinite variations--including, and probably starring the incredible Lamb in Saffron, Apricot, Coconut, and Poppy Seed Curry. In the essays that accompany each chapter, Greeley takes great care to provide a cultural foundation for the food she is presenting, and strives to reduce the intimidation factor faced by chefs in unfamiliar territory.Asian Soups, Stews, and Curriesis a great introduction for the novice Asian chef, and for those with more experience, Greeley provides a treasure trove of great recipes.--Mark O.

    "description": "THE MACMILLAN WORLD ATLASExperience the beauty and majesty of our planet as never before in Macmillan's revolutionary new atlas. Peerless in quality, design, and practicality,The Macmillan World Atlascombines precise, completely digitized maps and glorious satellite photographs to display the world with an accuracy and splendor unprecedented in atlas publishing.The Macmillan World Atlashas been created by the distinguished Bertelsman Cartographic Institute/GeoData to meet the changing needs of a changing world. For the past several years, the institute has been collaborating with leading cartographers and geographers throughout the world to develop a database of fully digitized cartography that is without equal in accuracy of its information, the usefulness of its content, and the contemporary elegance of its design. The result is a book at once fresh and cosmopolitan. Its mapping harnesses the most recent advances in computer cartography; its content incorporates an explosion of new knowledge about our planet; and its central informing philosophy is to show the world as the unified, interdependent community it has become.The cartographic choices and innovations that makeThe Macmillan World Atlasunique bear out these qualities. Among the features of the atlas are the following:THE WORLD IN PHOTOGRAPHS AND MAPSThanks to satellite photography, we now know more than ever before about how the planet actually appears from space. Taking advantage of this information, and paying homage to the beauty of the Earth,The Macmillan World Atlasopens with a series of spectacular aerial photographs that show the colorful array of mountains, deltas, deserts, glaciers, and rivers that will be portrayed schematically in the map sections that follow. Satellite photographs also open each map section, so that you can see the continent as it looks from space before turning to the maps of the same area.ACCURACYThe major advantage of creating a digitized cartographic database is that it allows continuous updating as the world changes. Shifts in boundaries, names, and features are incorporated as they occur. Thus the maps inThe Macmillan World Atlasare completely up-to-date. In addition, the plotting of latitude and longitude of every coastline, river, city, and mountain is more precise and accurate here than in any previous atlas.NATURAL COLORATIONSome mapmakers show contour by assigning elevation a different color, resulting in maps that may portray a snow-topped mountain range in an artificial purple or orange. Others use strong shading for contour but color all the land in various shades of beige. InThe Macmillan World Atlas, new, more realistic use of color lets you see the world as it appears from space. Maps are colored naturalistically, and according to ecological zones instead of altitude. Ice floes and snow-covered mountain ranges appear as white, rain forests as green, deserts as brown. Altitudes are still shown, through shading and the use of graded colors within individual ecological zones. Thus the maps appear three-dimensional but not artificial.UNIFORN SCALE THROUGHOUT THE WORLDThe Macmillan World Atlasdeparts from the standard practice of using a variety of scales for different continents and countries and thus perpetuating cartographic misinformation. Here, for the first time in any major atlas, the entire world is shown in a single, unified, and detailed scale of 1:4.5 million. The uniform scale allows you to see accurately the relative size of various places throughout the world. It facilitates direct comparison of geographic regions: No longer does the entire subcontinent of India appear to be the same size as the relatively tiny British Isles. It is a remarkable experience to leaf through the book and see country after country in the same scale.PLUS CLOSER SCALE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTHERN CANADAAt the same time,The Macmillan World Atlasincludes an additional section of maps tailored for a U.S. and Canadian readership: 64 pages of maps on a scale of 1:2.25 million showing details of each state and province of the United States and southern Canada.PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR THE TRAVELERThe Macmillan World Atlasis designed to be as useful to the business and leisure travelers as it is attractive to the map lover. It includes details of continental road networks not found in any other atlas of its kind. The maps show the varying size of roadways through color and width, include route numbers and classifications, and indicate distances between points. They also show the location of airports and important natural and cultural sites. This combination of physical, cultural, and road information is unique, and makesThe Macmillan World Atlasespecially useful.EAST-TO-USE ORGANIZATIONThe atlas has been carefully designed to be easy to navigate through as soon as you open it up. The table of contents includes photo icons quickly directing you to each section. Sample maps explain from the outset how the book functions. Each continent opens with its own contents page that includes small locator maps and photos of important cultural and natural sites. Each map spread includes a time zone; a small locator map indicating where the area is on its continent; pointers showing where to go to find the continuation of the map; and the scale, in both kilometers and miles.HIGHEST PRODUCTION VALUESBound in durable linen and printed on heavy coated stock,The Macmillan World Atlasis produced with the highest quality materials designed to showcase the beauty of its content and to last through many years of use.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "In this work, business consultant Hammond and business writer Morrison have identified what they feel are the seven cultural forces that define our country's national character and determine how we (individually, organizationally, and nationally) respond to the opportunities and challenges we encounter. The seven forces are our insistence on choice, the pursuit of impossible dreams, an obsession with big and more, an impatience with time, an acceptance of mistakes, an urge to improvise, and a fascination with 'what's new. 'As such,the forces 'script our endeavors, chart our activities, plot our responses, explain our processes and, in the end, define us as Americans. 'The book is laced with numerous examples from a variety of settings that support the authors' arguments. Thought - provoking, persuasive, and entertaining, this work is also repetitious and at times tries too hard to prove its point.Recommended primarily for larger business and social science collections. ?

She traces the history of the cat in Egypt, Rome, Europe, Asia, and America, presents fascinating accounts of cat breeds from the Abyssinian to the Turkish Van, and explains cat behaviors such as hissing, kneading, and purring. Aside from profiling famous cats in advertising, films, and cartoons such as Garfield and Krazy Kat and unusual cats such as Wiffy, the cat mayor of Guffey, Colorado, Altman offers classic short stories and poems by authors such as Aesop, Colette, and Poe. She also traces the origins of such expressions as 'raining cats and dogs.' There are appendixes for cat boutiques, cat clubs, and humane societies and listings of travel destinations for cat lovers, including museums, bed and breakfasts, and bookstores. One of the most charming entries is the Library Cat Society, which encourages the presence of cats in libraries. This unique work will bring hours of enjoyment to cat lovers.

Chock-full of delicious and decadent recipes that use natural sweeteners instead of granulated, refined white and brown sugars, The Naturally Sweet Baker is not about deprivation&#151;it&#39;s about indulgence. Author Carrie Davis proves that using natural sweeteners, such as honey and maple syrup, will result in some very sweet and tasty desserts. Just listen to these treats: Cinnamon Pecan Sticky Buns, Devil&#39;s Food Cake with Italian Meringue Chocolate Buttercream, Black Raspberry Ripple Ice Cream, and Banana Chocolate Cr&#234;pes. Those ought to excite your sweet tooth! Not only are natural sweeteners delicious, but they are good for you, too. Natural sweeteners contain minerals and vitamins; the process of producing refined sugar, however, strips it of its nutrients, leaving behind only &quot;empty&quot; calories. If you&#39;re thinking you have to shop in natural food stores to use this book, think again. Carrie makes it all very simple with descriptions and explanations of each sweetener&#151;maple sugar, barley malt syrup, and molasses, just to name a few. Many of the sweeteners are probably already in your pantry. And for those that aren&#39;t, there is a convenient mail order list so you can stock up on your favorite ingredients. With chapters on breakfast treats, cakes, cookies, ice creams, cobblers, and pastries, you&#39;ll never run out of ideas. The Naturally Sweet Baker is your source for decadent sweets without refined sugar.",

Dr. Richard Coop, one of the foremost sports psychologists in the country, has developed a unique mental approach to the game, helping both skilled pros and beginning amateurs alike to play better. Mind Over Golf examines all the demanding psychological challenges of golf and explains in detail how to conquer them. Golfers have discovered that there are ways to lower their scores that go beyond getting tips on their swing and stance. In order to play better, you have to find the key that allows your natural athletic ability to come to the fore, without being impeded by anxiety about making a poor shot. By following Dr. Coop&#39;s principles and ideas you&#39;ll be in the strongest possible position, both physically and mentally, to put your best swing on each shot. As Payne Stewart says in his foreword to Mind Over Golf, &quot;Not everyone can swing like a tour pro, but most everyone has it within himself or herself to think like one, and Dr. Coop lays the foundation for that within these pages.&quot; Visit us online at http://www.mcp.com/mgr/macmillan",

Author of the 15-Minute Gourmet series, Paulette Mitchell has become accustomed to efficiency in the kitchen. InThe Complete Soy Cookbook, she continues the quick but healthy trend in cooking using soy. As she notes, 'the recipes rely on the imaginative use of ingredients rather than elaborate techniques. 'Mitchell includes a description of soyfoods and the facts regarding soybeans as they relate to many of today's primary health concerns. Learn how to make soy part of your healthful lifestyle using a variety of ingredients, including different types of tofu, tempeh, and soybeans (dry, canned, and fresh).The Complete Soy Cookbookprovides recipes suited to every occasion, from quick weekday meals to elegant entertaining. The style is best described as fusion cooking: Mitchell blends elements of many diverse cuisines in her book.'This culinary chameleon truly is one of the most versatile foods on earth, 'Mitchell writes, and it's evident in recipes such as curried sweet Potato Soup, Tofu-Mushroom Stroganoff, Tempeh Paella, Tofu Tiramisu, Soybean Bourguignonne, and Tempeh Strips and Broccoli with Ancho Chili Sauce. 'I became determined to take a gourmet approach and turn meatless mealtime into vegetarian dining,' notes Mitchell.

    "description": "Beryl Bainbridge seems drawn to disaster. First she tackled the  unfortunate Scott expedition to the South Pole inThe Birthday Boys; later (but emphatically pre-DiCaprio) came the sinking of the Titanic, inEvery Man for Himself. Now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the Crimean War, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the Light Brigade's charge--but, thankfully, without the Tennysonian bombast. 'Some pictures,' a character confides, 'would only cause alarm to ordinary folk.' There's a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:Master Georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.Bainbridge's narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of George Hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous Liverpool life by heading for the Crimean Peninsula in 1854. His journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: Myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her 'Master Georgie' becomes an overriding obsession; Pompey Jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and George's sometime lover; and Dr. Potter, George's scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the war's carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.United by a sudden death in a Liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. In between, Bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses 'fractured into a spider's web'; a decapitated leg, toes 'poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot'; two dead men 'on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands.' Glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.Master Georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, 'Prophetic Truth,'for use in the pulpit.These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes.During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated.When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy.Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth(or God 's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.'--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",

    "description": "Widely known in Canada from hisMontreal Gazettecolumn, and work with the Discovery Channel, Schwarcz (Let Them Eat Flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies, advertising claims, special interest groups, age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

The latest in the publisher's series of regional cookbooks (others on Italy, China and Asia have preceded it), it will keep readers turning pages even if they never pick up a saucepan. Chapters alternate between discussing the different regions of France and offering a good selection of traditional recipes.

This is hearty, not haute , cuisine: well-organized recipes are scaled for the average cook, who won't have to go in search of rare ingredients or spend hours chopping and mincing.

Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text.

Newly revised and updated, this indispensable history of social libertarian thought now reaches into the 21st century&mdash;touching upon themes echoed in other recent titles, including Raj Patel'sThe Value of Nothing. Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&mdash;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&mdash;and less expected contributors&mdash;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "Hercule Poirot fans will be pleased to hear Hugh Fraser, who plays Captain Hastings on PBS's Mystery!and A&amp;E'sPoirot, recount Christie's intriguing 1948 novel (published in the U.S. asThere Is a Tide). The celebrated Belgian sleuth visits the sleepy English village of Warmsley Vale to check into the background of Gordon Cloade, supposedly a victim of the London Blitz. He had wed an attractive young widow, the former Mrs. Underhay, now the sole possessor of the Cloade family fortune. The deceased's sister-in-law told Poirot that 'spirits ' informed her that the widow's first husband is still among the living, raising suspicions about Cloade's demise. Fraser's tone at once reassures listeners that, just as on television, they are in capable hands. He does a fine job creating a variety of character voices, distinguishing one from another with clarity but without excessive flamboyance. The release of any Christie is an event, and it does not taken an abundance of 'little gray cells' to deduce that this audio will be well-received.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "Cussler's ( Raise the Titanic ) durable hero Dirk Pitt returns with Al Giordino, his amiable hulk of a sidekick, to save mankind from a greedy industrialist in cahoots with a despot and to solve a few historical riddles along the way. Dirk meets beautiful Eva Rojas, a World Health Organization team member inspecting a mysterious epidemic that has struck in the Sahara, when he interrupts an attempt on her life. Then the National Underwater and Marine Agency sends Pitt and Giordino up the Niger on a gunboat to find the source of a toxin that causes red tide organisms to reproduce out of control, threatening to poison the oceans and deplete the earth's oxygen supply. The pairalso in next sentence is captured by evil billionaire Yves Massarde and Mali's tyrannical despot Gen. Kazim, but they escape to find the source of the pollution at Fort Foreau, Massarde's desert toxic waste factory that receives--but doesn't dispose of--nuclear and chemical wastes. Recaptured, Pitt and Giordino are sent to Kazim's desert slave camp, where they find Eva and her team--marked for death. A deadly trek across the Sahara is their only hope. Cussler champions ecological issues with verve, and continues his love affair with history by tossing in a Confederate ironside stranded in the Sahara near the remains of an aviatrix lost during the 30 s.Some judicious cutting might have improved the narrative, but it's great fun nonetheless, putting Beau Geste swashbucklers against the vilest of villains.

    "description": "Provence is loved for its sunlit beauty and earthy, tantalizing cuisine. Both are celebrated inProvence the Beautiful Cookbook, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book authorRichard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made. Wine information and a glossary conclude the portrait of Provence and its table--a feast for the eye and palate alike.--Arthur Boehm",

    "description": "Recipe collection, travelogue, history lesson and art book, the 13th of the publisher's Beautiful Cookbooks may be the most ambitious, and is surely among the most accomplished of the series. IACP and James Beard Foundation Award-winner Goldstein (Back to Square One; Festive Occasions) has exercised masterful selection skills to balance this sampling of 250 recipes from a region that supports a wealth of culinary traditions, including southern Italian, Provencal France and coastal Spain; Turkey, the Middle East and northern Africa; Greece and the Balkans. Food scholar Ayla Aygar's comprehensive essay on the culinary and geo-political history of the Mediterranean region introduces the seven chapters, which are organized around courses and types of dishes, and feature recipes from each culinary tradition. Interspersed among chapters are shorter essays discussing the culinary heritage of each region. The recipes, which generally suggest variations found in other countries (and are an etymologist's delight), are uncomplicated, gracefully written, accessible to the American home cook and highlight the area's abundance of vegetables and fish. Of particular note are the chapters on soups and fish, ranging from the simplicity of Turkish grilled swordfish to Sicilian stuffed squid, and including four variations on a Moroccan fish marinade. With 250 photographs, this volume is also a feast for the eye. Author tour.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Vilified by his fellow Victorians for his sexuality and dandyism, these days he is hailed as a sexual liberator. Yet this is not how Wilde saw himself. His lifestyle and pretenses did not bring him happiness and fulfillment: his art did. And this is where Pearce's search for the man behind the masks is centered. Rather than lingering on the actions that brought him notoriety, Joseph Pearce explores the emotional and spiritual search of this fascinating and complex figure.The Unmasking of Oscar Wildereveals how his 'heart of stone' was broken by his two-year prison sentence, while it probes the deeper implications of his masterpieces. Along with a discussion ofThe Ballad of Reading Gaoland the posthumously publishedDe Profundis,it also traces his fascination with Catholicism through to his eleventh-hour conversion.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Robin Hobb, author of the Farseer trilogy, has returned to that world  for a new series.Ship of Magicis a sea tale, reminiscent ofMoby DickandPatrick O'Brian'sAubrey/Maturin series in its details of shipboard life. It is also a fantasy adventure with sea serpents, pirates, and  all sorts of magic. Theliveshipshave distinct personalities and partner with specific people, somewhat likeAnne McCaffrey'sBrain ships and their Brawns, though these are trading ships and have full  crews.Hobb has peopled the book with many wonderfully developed characters.  Most of the primary ones are members of the Vestritts, an Old Trader family which owns the liveshipVivacia.  Their stories are intercut with those of Kennit, the ambitious pirate Brashen, the disinherited scion of another family who served on the Vestritt's ship, andParagon, an old liveship  abandoned and believed mad.   The sentient sea serpents have their own story hinted at, as well.ThoughShip of Magicis full of action, none of the plotlines get resolved in this book. Readers who resent being left with many questions and few answers after almost 700 pages should think twice before starting, or wait until the rest of the series is out so that their suspense won't be too prolonged. But Hobb's writing draws you in and makes you care desperately about what will happen next, the mark of a terrific storyteller.--Nona Vero--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "During the biggest snowstorm in the history of Philadelphia, the jury is out. The defense is confident of a verdict of not guilty, but then client Elliot Steere admits to his council that he is a murderer. Marta Richter does not take this revelation happily. In fact, she's so outraged that she wants her client's secret revealed no matter what it does to her career. Steere isn't about to let her blow his chances, and with powerful connections, money, and muscle, he works from his jail cell to silence Marta and her colleagues before the sequestered jury makes a decision. If readers like soap opera?type cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, a plot that reads like a TV script, and a little gory violence here and there, they will like this book. The characters are well thought out, but most often sequences of the story unfold implausibly, as when Marta hunts for clues in her client's house and boat. Attorney Bennie Rosato, the feisty character from a previous Scottoline novel (Legal Tender, LJ 7/96), makes an appearance here but is not very involved in the plot except for a 'save - the - day ' routine in the last few chapters. This is essential for readers already hooked on Scottoline, but don't start with this one when introducing her to readers.-?Shirley Gibson Coleman, Ann Arbor Dist.

    "description": "Masquerading as a trashy novelist may solve English writer Isobel Latimer's financial problems, but it also plunges her into a full-fledged identity crisis in Gregory's flighty, overplotted novel. Isobel needs money to support her ailing husband, Philip, and his newfound interest in pool building, so when her agent, Troy Cartwright, informs her that her literary novels are earning less and less, she tells him, 'If they won't pay me to write good books, then I'll just have to write bad.' She and Troy invent the persona of Zelda Vere, a heavily made-up, well-dressed blonde bombshell, the opposite of 52-year-old country matron Isobel. Zelda's 'survivor fiction,' The Devil's Disciple, is a major hit that earns Isobel all the money she could ever need, but she finds herself increasingly caught between superego and id, between an unfulfilling loyal marriage and sexual experimentation with Troy. When Isobel sets off on her book tour with Troy, Gregory's plot takes an exotic and erotic turn, depicting a world of cross-dressing, cocaine and champagne. Returning to her home in Kent, Isobel finds Philip miraculously recovered and expending all his energy on the construction of an expensive new pool. Philip has also decided to invest (with Isobel's money) in the handsome pool man's business. Backstabbers reveal themselves, to no one's surprise, and Isobel's deliberationsAshould she stay or should she go?Aare prolonged until an abrupt, bewildering denouement puts a stop to the runaway narrative. Gregory, a popular writer of historical fiction (Earthly Joys, etc.), knows whereof she speaks when she describes television interviews and book deals, though the over-the-top fantasy she spins from the details may test readers' patience.

    "description": "The dazzling pyrotechnics of British author Smith's last two future noir spectacles, Spares (under option to DreamWorks) and One of Us (under option to Warner Brothers), are prefigured in his promise-filled debut novel, a 1994 U.K. paperback original now seeing its first hardcover publication. Set in a stylized future City where individuals live in neighborhoods organically responsive to their moods and lifestyles, the story begins as a routine missing persons case for its narrator, Stark, an irreverent soft-boiled detective type who specializes in 'finding people, or things.' Stark's retrieval of Fell Alkland, a scientist who has fled the driven environment of Action Center for the placid Stable neighborhood, proves relatively easy. But pursuit by Action Center operatives and Alkland's crippling work-related nightmares force Stark and his quarry to escape to Jeamland, a collective repository of dreams and childhood memories that Stark appears to know very well, and to which, as he discovers only belatedly, he has been lured back deliberately. The genius of Smith's narrative is its casual revelation that the detective scenario and detailed elaborations of the City that pull the reader into the story are clue-filled set-ups for the real story of Stark's self-discovery in Jeamland. Ultimately, this requires chapters of explanatory exposition that slow down the finale and betray the awkwardness of a new writer growing into his skills. Nevertheless, the story blazes with a visionary intensity that fires its imagery and fuels its premise that 'once you've gone forward, you can't go home again.' (Dec.)Philip K.

She begins to pull herself together when a journalist tells her that the crash was no accident, that it was a terrorist bombing covered up by the world's intelligence agencies. Then the journalist is murdered, and Stephanie is recruited into a shadowy law enforcement agency to become a killer. If the plot of this first novel sounds a little like the movie and TV seriesLa Femme Nikita, that's understandable. But Burnell manages to inject some new life into the tired premise. Stephanie is a tough, resilient heroine, seriously challenged by the multiple personalities she's forced to don, while focused laserlike on avenging her family's death. Even the terrorists emerge as more than cardboard cutouts, especially in the climactic scene in which Stephanie confronts her antagonist. What begins as a B-movie knockoff ends as an entertaining meditation on the futility of terrorist brinkmanship.George Needham--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Sisterly rivalry is the basis of this fresh, wonderfully vivid retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn. Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king's court at a young age, as players in their uncle's plans to advance the family's fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII's favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry's graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George ('kin and enemies all at once') feel for each other and the toll their family's ambition takes on them. Mary, the story's narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne's famous, tragic end is offset by Mary's happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader's mind.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",

    "description": "Guardian angels have attained such trendy status in American popular fiction that it's refreshing to read Vickers, a writer from across the Atlantic, whose subtle depiction of a life touched by a heavenly spirit carries not a hint of clich&#x82;. Her debut novel is an unpretentious gem of a book that charts the late coming-of-age of Miss Julia Garnet, a retired English schoolteacher who spends six months in Venice after her lifelong companion, Harriet, dies. Venice has a magical effect on reserved Julia: a dyed-in-the-wool Communist, she relaxes in her antipathy toward religion, and even begins to visit the local church. There, she becomes enamored of a series of paintings that tell the story of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, a tale that mixes elements of Judaism with the religion of Zoroaster. In the story, young Tobias travels to Medea, part of the Persian Empire, to collect a debt for his father, blind Tobit. He is accompanied on his journey by a hired guide who turns out to be the Angel Raphael. As Julia learns more about Tobias's trek, she embarks upon a soul-altering journey of her own. She falls in love with an art dealer, Carlo, and befriends Sarah and Toby, twins working on the restoration of a Venetian chapel. When Toby disappears suddenly, after discovering a priceless Renaissance painting, Julia finds out that neither Carlo nor the twins are exactly what they seem--but that the Angel Raphael's watchful spirit will help good prevail. (Feb.)Forecast: This touching novel, a sleeper hit in Britain, should win American fans eager for a treatment of religious themes without the gooey sentiment that often accompanies the topic of angels.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

Growing up as an ill-used apprentice to Morach, the much-feared wise woman of the moors, Alys finds respite by joining an order of Catholic nuns. When young Lord Hugo and his men burn the abbey to the ground during a drunken rampage, Alys is the only one to escape; she flees back to Morach, consumed with guilt at having abandoned her dying sisters. Summoned to minister to Lord Hugh, Hugo's father, Alys soon finds herself deeply involved in the treachery and intrigue surrounding the old man's attempts to have his son's marriage to the barren Lady Catherine annulled. Attracted to Hugo despite his murderous past, Alys begins to practice witchcraft in earnest to rid him of Catherine and become his wife. Her spells work all too well: Catherine's long-awaited pregnancy ends disastrously, and Hugo comes to love Alys, but in a sickly haze of lust that provides no basis for marriage. Alys soon finds herself so sunk in evil, so removed from God's love, that only a truly shocking gesture can bring about her salvation. Gregory adeptly manipulates hair-raising horror and mounting suspense, brilliantly evoking the period's turbulent atmosphere.

Her latest, rich with the emerald allure of the lush Irish landscape and tart with Kelly's sexy, bracing humor, follows four diverse women linked to the charming Kerry town of Redlion. Hope Parker, 37 ('Mrs.Tracksuit Bottom '), is the mother of two, wife of Matt, who is an ad exec/closet novelist and heir of his uncle's Curlew Cottage in Redlion. Hope fears she will lose her handsome husband-('The seven year itch wasn't just an itch; it was a damn outbreak of eczema')-and quickly agrees to accompany him for a year's writing sabbatical during which her marriage is surprisingly challenged by her attraction to another man.Hope's sister, Samantha (Sam) Smith, 'teetering on the abyss of 40,' is a hip London music mogul, rattled by a doctor's diagnosis and a raging discontent that can be dealt with only when she finally admits what she needs.Virginia Connell, 58, a grieving widow from Dublin, moves to Redlion, takes up golf and finds that there is life after loss.Discontented Irish / Indian Nicole Turner, 23, loves karaoke but dreams of singing professionally.After she's discovered by one of Sam's A & R people, Nicole learns that fame and fortune pale in comparison to her need for independence and love.Surrounding these women are many thoroughly developed supporting characters and sufficient side plots to fuel a sequel.Romance fans should rejoice in this chatty, comfortable story, as warm and satisfying as Irish oatmeal.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Kosko , an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, makes a provocative new scientific paradigm intelligible to the general reader. Fuzzy logic posits a world in which absolutes, such as those implied in the words 'true' and 'false', are less important and interesting than the matters of degree between them. 'Fuzziness is grayness,' and 'the truth lies in the middle,' according to Kosko, one of the pioneers of fuzzy logic theory, which he persuasively presents as a world view rooted more in Buddhist and Taoist assumptions than in the dichotomous Aristotelian tradition. He proposes FATs (Fuzzy Approximation Theorems) for the existence (and non-existence, as fuzziness demands) of God and as models of the abortion debate. In consumer terms, fuzzy logic is behind such 'smart' machines as air conditioners and microwave ovens that gauge their operation to the conditions and demands of a given moment's task. Writing with style and risk, Kosko challenges assumptions, not about the existence of scientific authority, but about its nature.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "At the beginning of Amy Tan's fourth novel, two packets of papers written in Chinese calligraphy fall into the hands of Ruth Young. One bundle is titledThings I Know Are Trueand the other,Things I Must Not Forget. The author? That would be the protagonist's mother, LuLing, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In these documents the elderly matriarch, born in China in 1916, has set down a record of her birth and family history, determined to keep the facts from vanishing as her mind deteriorates.A San Francisco career woman who makes her living by ghostwriting self-help books, Ruth has little idea of her mother's past or true identity. What's more, their relationship has tended to be an angry one. Still, Ruth recognizes the onset of LuLing's decline--along with her own remorse over past rancor--and hires a translator to decipher the packets. She also resolves to 'ask her mother to tell her about her life.For once, she would ask.She would listen.She would sit down and not be in a hurry or have anything else to do .'Framed at either end by Ruth's chapters, the central portion ofThe Bonesetter's Daughtertakes place in China in the remote, mountainous region where anthropologists discovered Peking Man in the 1920s. Here superstition and tradition rule over a succession of tiny villages. And here LuLing grows up under the watchful eye of her hideously scarred nursemaid, Precious Auntie. As she makes clear, it's not an enviable setting:I noticed the ripe stench of a pig pasture, the pockmarked land dug up by dragon-bone dream-seekers, the holes in the walls, the mud by the wells, the dustiness of the unpaved roads. I saw how all the women we passed, young and old, had the same bland face, sleepy eyes that were mirrors of their sleepy minds.Nor is rural isolation the worst of it. LuLing's family, a clan of ink makers, believes itself cursed by its connection to a local doctor, who cooks up his potions and remedies from human bones. And indeed, a great deal of bad luck befalls the narrator and her sister GaoLing before they can finally engineer their escape from China. Along the way, familial squabbles erupt around every corner, particularly among mothers, daughters, and sisters. And as she did in her earlierThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan uses these conflicts to explore the intricate dynamic that exists between first-generation Americans and their immigrant elders.--Victoria Jenkins--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Without a sharp focus, authors tackle the history of modern India at their peril. French, whose first book, Younghusband, won the 1995 Somerset Maugham Award, tries to do a bit too much. It's difficult to uncover new ground in the well-spaded turf of Indian independence. French is not the first to see Gandhi as a crank obsessed with bowel functions, Winston Churchill as a racist and the 1947 British exit strategy as a case of muddling through. He does, however, succeed at filling in some gaps, especially about British intelligence operations. French (who ran for Britain's parliament as a Green candidate and is currently director of the Free Tibet Campaign) nagged the Foreign Office to declassify 92 'bottle - green boxes' of files, and his analysis reveals a dying Raj under severe financial stress held together by undercover operations. Although his criticisms of Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre's Freedom at Midnight are unlikely to dethrone that classic, he argues persuasively that the authors swallowed an elderly Lord Mountbatten's egocentric recollections and inaccurately made the creation of Pakistan a cliff-hanger dependent on the health of Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Noteworthy also are glimpses of various British viceroys, perspectives on the amalgamation of the princely states into the nation and an update on the increasing adulation in India of Axis ally Subhas Chandra Bose. French's travel notes and wit leaven the narrative somewhat, but many readers will find that this demanding journey covers too much territory too quickly.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

In this slim debut novel, he tells a coming-of-age tale of a fairly unpleasant young actor from Texas named William who lives in Manhattan and is working his way through an ugly little relationship with a singer/songwriter named Sarah. William's parents married young and split up early and he's not too happy with the world at large. Sarah can't quite make heads or tails of her mother. The pair has sex in the bathroom and talks quite a bit about their relationship. It all has a certain ring of truth, but at this point it's probably safe to say that Hawke's movie agent will probably make a better living off the young actor/writer than Hawke's literary agent.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "With his new bookTrilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution, Richard Fortey confirms his status as one of the best communicators of science around today. His hugely enjoyable previous book,Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth, was shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc science book prize, butTrilobite!is sure to receive even greater acclaim. WhereasLifetook the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--Trilobite!sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author. A delightful read.--Chris Lavers, Amazon.co.uk--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

    "description": "Any talk ofThe Namesake--Jhumpa Lahiri's follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut,Interpreter of Maladies--must begin with a name: Gogol Ganguli. Born to an Indian academic and his wife, Gogol is afflicted from birth with a name that is neither Indian nor American nor even really a first name at all. He is given the name by his father who, before he came to America to study at MIT, was almost killed in a train wreck in India. Rescuers caught sight of the volume of Nikolai Gogol's short stories that he held, and hauled him from the train. Ashoke gives his American-born son the name as a kind of placeholder, and the awkward thing sticks.Awkwardness is Gogol's birthright. He grows up a bright American boy, goes to Yale, has pretty girlfriends, becomes a successful architect, but like many second-generation immigrants, he can never quite find his place in the world. There's a lovely section where he dates a wealthy, cultured young Manhattan woman who lives with her charming parents. They fold Gogol into their easy, elegant life, but even here he can find no peace and he breaks off the relationship.  His mother finally sets him up on a blind date with the daughter of a Bengali friend, and Gogol thinks he has found his match. Moushumi, like Gogol, is at odds with the Indian-American world she inhabits. She has found, however, a circuitous escape: 'At Brown, her rebellion had been academic...she'd pursued a double major in French. Immersing herself in a third language, a third culture, had been her refuge--she approached French, unlike things American or Indian, without guilt, or misgiving, or expectation of any kind.'Lahiri documents these quiet rebellions and random longings with great sensitivity.There 's no cleverness or showing - off inThe Namesake, just beautifully confident storytelling.Gogol's story is neither comedy nor tragedy;it 's simply that ordinary, hard - to - get - down - on - paper commodity: real life.--Claire Dederer--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

A student runs away from boarding school and meets an elderly lady, whom he later discovers is a ghost. She tells the story of another boy, Bertie, who grew up long ago in Africa and eventually became her husband. Lonely and neglected by his parents, he rescues an abandoned white lion cub and cares for it, gradually forming a close bond. After some years the boy's parents abruptly decide to send him to school in England and sell the lion. Bertie attempts to save the animal by returning it to the jungle, but it has lost its ability to survive in the wild and returns to the only home it has known. A French circus owner buys the lion, and the boy vows never to forget him. Twelve years later, Bertie fights in World War I and is decorated for rescuing wounded comrades. In a small French town he finally finds his lion, starving and near death, and the two friends are reunited. Heartened by the woman's tale, the student returns to school. This touching story is well written and emotionally satisfying. Readers will be drawn to this fascinating tale of a unique friendship between boy and beast. In addition to being a successful adventure story, the book demonstrates the value of character?of keeping promises, standing up for one's beliefs, and courage under fire.?Gebregeorgis Yohannes, San Francisco Public Library, CACopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Grade 5-8&ndash;Australian actress Caroline Lee enthusiastically and energetically narrates this recording of Elyne Mitchell's 1958 novel about wild horses (brumbies) in Australia. It is the story of Thowra, a silvery-white brumby, who becomes leader of his own herd over the course of the book, defeating other stallions and evading the men who try to capture him. This fairly realistic horse story occasionally slips into a more fantastical style, such as when the horses converse with each other and with other animals (cows, kangaroos, dingoes) and when Mitchell attributes human emotions and thoughts to Thowra. Lee's voice walks, trots, canters, and gallops through the story, as appropriate to the action. The book is prefaced with an Australian glossary, primarily consisting of descriptions of the local flora and fauna. There are musical cues for the beginning and end of each chapter as well as each side of the tape.

    "description": "The latest installment in the Wars of Light and Shadow series,  also the third movement of an inner story arc called the  Alliance of Light, well represents the vast and tangled plot  lines readers have come to expect from this prolific and popular  author. In the first book in the series, Curse of the Mistwraith  (1993), the half-brothers dark Arithon s'Ffalenn and blond  Lysaer s'Ilessid were set against each other by the eponymous  enemy, and now, 30-some years later, they're still going after  each other. This book's action begins in mid-flight during a  winter gale, with Arithon fleeing the walled city Jaelot, where  he's been imprisoned. With him he drags the unwilling peasant  Fionn Areth Caid'an, magically raised as his double to trap him.  Soon they join forces with Dakar the Mad Prophet (whose  prophecies have an erratic track record, though some have been  important), assigned by the Fellowship of Sorcerers to defend  our protagonist. Dakar has supplies and horses ready. Much  geography is traversed with many turgid pages spent attempting  to describe the indescribable effects of magic. Occasionally the  focus moves to Lysaer, with his large retinue of soldiers and  fanatic priests, who in private practice rituals as sorcerous as  the techniques of which they accuse Arithon. While fans have  compared this series to Robert Jordan's extended Wheel of Time  series, newcomers may be put off by the stilted language ('The guard captain's baleful stillness held threat') and the mishmash  of plot.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "In this splendid fantasy about two warriors, a princess, and a demonic plot, the last is against Princess Anja of Sessalie, whom Commander Taskin thinks has been kidnapped. Captain Mykkael thinks there is more to it than that, but because of his race and mercenary background, he isn't readily believed until civil war threatens to break out in Sessalie. Meanwhile, Princess Anja has fled far away, and Mykkael has to flee for his own life, overtake her, enlist help for her, and finally lead her to safety through the monster-haunted terrain of Hell's Chasm. Once a marriage is arranged into a family of potent sorcerers, Anja can see about saving her realm and family, while Mykkael takes vengeance on the demons who, many years ago, drove him from his homeland and love. Wurts is skillful as ever at world-building and pacing, and her background as an artist shows in the kind of intensely visual writing that makes one wish more fantasy were written by artists.Roland GreenCopyright &# 169;American Library Association.All rights reserved--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",

    "description": "Describing itself as 'A Hip Guide to Modern Witchcraft,' this uninhibited offering from Australian witch, rock diva, model and media personality Horne is pure pop entertainment, reading more like a feature in a fashion magazine than an account of the present-day practice of Wicca. Steeped in girlfriend-to-girlfriend attitude and style, Horne's funky and relentlessly positive prose ('[Eve] was,in fact, a benevolent and switched - on sister....') is liable to infuriate practiced occultists while proving irresistible to young people fascinated by or even just curious about witchcraft. Part memoir and part manual, the book offers snapshots of just about every part of a modern witch's practice, from casting spells and observing Wiccan sabbaths to setting up an altar and practicing 'skyclad ' (or nude)Anot to mention how to make magic with, for and during sex. Although this guidebook can safely be characterized as a lighthearted romp through the practice of witchcraft, it does contain some useful and well-organized reference material, such as a glossary of 'magickal ' herbs, a calendar of the witch's year and a full complement of easy-to-follow spells for love, money and so forth. Occasionally, ethical qualms silence Horne's ready tongue, leading to curiously unusable directives (as in 'Bitchcraft,' the chapter on hexing, where she describes in graphic detail the preparation and abuse of an enemy's effigy, but primly refuses to tell you what to say while you're doing it). Experienced Wiccans and occultists will want to turn to more authoritative sources, but as it stands, this is an appealing introduction for the dabbler, the dreamer and other wide-eyed seekers of modern-day magic. (Jan.) Forecast: From the sexy photo of Horne on its jacket to its overall pop approach and its unusually low price (especially for a hardcover containing color photos), this title promises to be the witchcraft book of 2001. Thorsons is backing it with a three-city author tour and a 60,000 print run. Expect the book to cast a spell on readers, resulting in charmed sales.Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

    "description": "'The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it  was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime.'Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being.At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house: She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days.  Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed.  But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70 - year - old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island.As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would - be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake.Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra.So when the 'skin-crawling feeling of being watched' doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end ? So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond 's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished.In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative.But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense.--Kelly Flynn--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",

Years earlier, King Elrius usurped his sister's rightful claim to the throne--an act that abrogated the divine protections set over his people, bringing plague and war to the land. There are those who would see the divine prophecies honored, however, and a warrior queen restored to the throne. So Tobin is disguised by means of dark magic that conceals her true gender with that of her twin brother, who was killed at birth, but not fast enough. He drew a single breath, which was enough to keep his soul earthbound and horribly angry. Tobin will indeed be queen, but only if she can be protected until adulthood from her insane mother, her demonic brother, and every evil wizard in the land. This terrific tale is dark and exciting, and the magic in it is truly wonderful.Paula LuedtkeCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

    "description": "Entering its centennial year, the Times Literary Supplement, that British bastion of highbrow book culture, has a circulation of just 35,000. So it should not surprise anyone if a 600-page, painstakingly thorough history of the supplement generates sales somewhat more meager than that. This is something of a shame, for despite its wrist-cracking bulk and geological pace, this volume is stylishly written, affectionate and more entertaining than it has any right to be. May, a TLS contributor and longtime Times man, closely chronicles the supplement's tenuous start (it was originally issued to cover book reviews squeezed out of the regular Times by parliamentary reports) and frequent financial crises the TLS would inevitably be rescued in the nick of time by one high-minded millionaire or another. May faithfully traces the rise of such famous contributors as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, freed by anonymity (there were no bylines in those days) to write searingly vivid critiques. (Of one unlucky title Woolf wrote, 'You draw from it that sense of instruction in unimportant matters which you get by looking from the train window at a flat stretch of countryside.') May is equally good following the uncertain early fate of works destined for immortality, like The Waste Land and Ulysses. The correspondence of hawk-eyed TLS subscribers, pouncing on errors in translations of Catullus, will delight those with a taste for the absurd. It is hard to imagine any but the most stout-hearted TLS reader undertaking this long journey from cover to cover, but American literary scholars will likely treasure this heroic record of a periodical that took the life of the mind more seriously than most.

    "description": "New to the U.S. but first published in Europe in 1992, Coelho's latest (following the bestsellingThe Zahir) is an old school parable of good and evil. When a stranger enters the isolated mountain town of Viscos with the devil literally by his side, the widow Berta knows (because her deceased husband, with whom she communicates daily, tells her) that a battle for the town's souls has begun. The stranger, a former arms dealer, calls himself Carlos and proposes a wager to the town: if someone turns up murdered within a week, he'll give the town enough gold to make everyone wealthy. Carlos ensures people believe him by choosing the town bartender, the orphan Chantal Prym, as his instrument: he shows her where the gold is, confides that his wife and children have been executed by kidnapper terrorists (remember: 1992), and that he is hoping his belief that people are basically evil will be vindicated. Chantal would like nothing better than to disappear with the gold herself and thus faces her own dilemmas. Add in corrupt townspeople (including a priest), sometimes biting social commentary and, distastefully, a very heavily stereotyped recurring town legend about an Arab named Ahab, and you've got quite a little Garden of Eden potboiler. But the unsatisfying ending lets everyone off the hook and leaves questions hanging like ripe apples.(July 3)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

    "description": "Miller is a young man with only a few years' professional experience in ministry, but his youth is a key feature in this book of travel memoirs. A record of a classic road trip, Miller's tale is full of serendipitous adventures and thoughtful Christian reflection, offering an unusual mix of travel mishaps in a broken-down (and often breaking down) VW van; youthful, somewhat macho bantering between friends; and the sort of deep-thought wanderings into meaning and significance that are the meat of college-age existence. The book's strongest point is the way in which it conveys the character of Miller and his companion--two young 'Republican hippies.' As we travel along with them, they can be fun, profound, annoying, hilarious and, at unguarded moments, surprisingly tender. Their insights are sometimes deep, sometimes naive, sometimes simple and sometimes just goofy. Their religious insights are similarly mixed in depth, but the two are remarkable and winsome in their aim at complete honesty. The narrator often allows himself to be portrayed in an unflattering light to faithfully recapture the experience. This book is an appealing Sunday afternoon read, a reminder that life is meant to be experienced and not just gotten through.

    "description": "Considered by many to be one of the very best Agatha Christie mysteries, this macabre tale has lost none of its crisp intrigue since it was first published in 1940. Using a plot formula that has since become a mystery standard, Christie conveniently gathers all the characters in one hard-to-leave location, in this case, the Jolly Roger, a vacation hotel on the southern coast of England. One of the guests, a gorgeous, dramatic flirt, is strangled to death, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot who happens to be vacationing at the Jolly Roger, too sets out to solve the case. Each of the well-developed characters is suspect, and listeners will constantly be changing their bets as to whodunit. British stage actor Suchet, who many know as the definitive Poirot from the Public Television Mystery! series was an obvious choice for the reader of this production, having won an Audie award for reading Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1997. Suchet gives an outstanding and highly entertaining performance, obviously taking great zeal in the task of fleshing out Christie's colorful lot of characters.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",
